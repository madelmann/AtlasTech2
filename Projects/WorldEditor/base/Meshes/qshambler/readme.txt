MD5 Loader Demo By A.J. Tavakoli
_____________________________________

This demo demonstrates the functionality of a loader I wrote
for Doom 3's MD5 model format.  This program loads, renders,
and animates an MD5 model (version 10).  Feel free to use my
model loader in your application.  If you do so, I would
appreciate it if you give me credit somewhere in your
documentation but do not require it.

The MD5 model packaged with the demo was taken from the
Shamblers Castle mod for Doom 3.  It was used with 
permission from Jason "heXum" McCord.  Thanks to the
Shamblers Castle team for the model.
